### [cmmc-level-1_profile.json](CMMC/cmmc-level-1_profile.json)

A default profile for CMMC Level 1 assessments based on [NIST SP 800-171 rev3](https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-content/tree/main/nist.gov/SP800-171/rev3)

Status:

- As some controls have been withdrwan or incorporated in another control as part of the SP 800-171 rev3 update, there are no longer the 17 controls as initially defined by [CMMC 2.0 Level 1](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-27280/cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-cmmc-program#sectno-reference-170.15). We believe we have the correct control ids but do not yet have official updated guidance from NIST or FAR 52.204-21.
- Some values missing
